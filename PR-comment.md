Thanks for your PR. I have a couple of questions/concerns...

1. I believe Quill also has another paste method available via `quill.pasteHTML()`.
   Were you aware of this and purposefully chose the one you did for a reason?
   If not, I am curious if one would be better than the other.

2. Can you set up a working version in `src/App.vue` so I can run it in development locally?
